# Installation Policy

This page describes how KiCad MCP Pro should be installable by users and contributors.

## User installation

Supported user-facing installation channels are documented in [`../installation.md`](../installation.md) and may include:

- Python package installation from PyPI;
- npm wrapper installation from npm;
- Docker images from GHCR;
- GUI bundles from GitHub Releases where available;
- source checkout for contributors and advanced users.

Installation instructions must identify prerequisites, expected package names, and verification commands.

## Uninstall and cleanup

The project should avoid writing persistent files outside user-selected configuration, cache, project, or package-manager directories. Uninstall should normally be handled by the package manager used for installation. Documentation should call out any persistent user configuration that may remain.

## Developer installation

Developer setup must be reproducible from repository files using FLOSS tooling:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv sync --all-extras --frozen
task ci
```

External tools such as KiCad, Docker, Node.js, Python, uv, pnpm, and Rust must be documented when they are needed for a specific workflow.
