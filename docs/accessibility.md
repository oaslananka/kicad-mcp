# Accessibility

KiCad MCP Pro is primarily a command-line, MCP, and documentation project. Accessibility requirements apply to the documentation site, generated references, screenshots, and any GUI or ChatGPT Apps SDK surface.

## Documentation

- Use semantic Markdown headings in order.
- Provide descriptive link text instead of bare “click here” wording.
- Keep code blocks copyable and label commands clearly.
- Avoid conveying essential meaning only through color.
- Provide alternative text or nearby explanatory text for screenshots and diagrams.

## GUI and web surfaces

When a GUI or web integration is changed, contributors should check:

- keyboard navigation for primary controls;
- visible focus states;
- labels for form controls and buttons;
- sufficient text contrast;
- readable error messages;
- no reliance on animation or timing for essential actions.

## Scope and limitations

The project does not yet claim a formal WCAG audit. Accessibility work is handled as an ongoing quality requirement and should be considered during UI or documentation changes.
